This project sets out to implement a generic image classification library that can take a training dataset of images and learn to  identify if they belong to a certain category or not. It comes with an API as well as a Web interface, so that the user can see similarities and other metrics after training a model.

Requirements:

- numpy
- scipy
- sklearn


## Installation:
